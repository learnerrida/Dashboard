Dashboard of StellAI to be published in streamlit
To install streamlit use the following command:
pip install streamlit
pip install streamlit-extras # This can be used when we are interested in using extra options
Once done, in Visual studio, create a project and a file named homepage.py 
Then, all other pages can be created with numbers as suffix :
01_
02_
In our case, there are 5 pages created:
1. Homepage : Will explain about the webpage
2.StellAI Dashboard - an admin dashboard
3.FAQs: Can be directly connected to StellAI Knowledge base and users can query it
4.Chatbot: Its a clone of Chatgpt
5.Userdashboard: Its a display of dashboard for users' consumption

The whole dashboard is created using streamlit and stream lit has some prerequisites to be published in an internet:
1.To set requirements.txt - This is where we have to upload all dependency libraries
2.to have a base page - in our case it is homepage.py
